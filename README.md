## Description

This application uses NPM, Node JS, Jest, Inquirer and JavaScript to create a SVG file. The word "basic" is used because the file is generated by a series of questions in the terminal which are limited to 3 charaters, text color, background color and file name. However, once the user creates the file, they can go back into the SVG file to then edit if they so choose to.
